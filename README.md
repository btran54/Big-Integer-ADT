Goal:=============================================================================

Our goal in this project is to create a BigInteger ADT in C++ that is capable of performing arithmetic operations on arbitrarily large signed integers. The underlying data structure for this ADT will be a List of longs. It will therefore be necessary to alter our List ADT from pa5 slightly. 

Files:=============================================================================

List.h - List header file containing the forward declaration of list functions

List.cpp - List CPP file containing the operation of functions

ListTest.cpp - List test file containing the testing of operations from List.cpp

BigInteger.h - BigInteger header file constaining the forward declaration of BigInteger functions

BigInteger.cpp - BigInteger CPP file containing the operation of functions

BigIntegerTest.cpp - BigInteger test file containing tests for the operations from BigInteger.cpp

Arithmetic.cpp - Arithmetic file containing the main execution of BigInteger functions

Makefile - File used to automate build process

README.md - Documentation of included files
